# # Introduction to NLTK
# 
# In part 1 we will use nltk to explore the Herman Melville novel Moby Dick. Then in part 2 you will create a spelling recommender function that uses nltk to find words similar to the misspelling. 

# ## Part 1 - Analyzing Moby Dick

# In[1]:

import nltk
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# If you would like to work with the raw text you can use 'moby_raw'
with open('moby.txt', 'r') as f:
    moby_raw = f.read()
    
# If you would like to work with the novel in nltk.Text format you can use 'text1'
moby_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(moby_raw)
text1 = nltk.Text(moby_tokens)


# ### Example 1
# 
# How many tokens (words and punctuation symbols) are in text1?
# 
# *This function should return an integer.*

# In[2]:

def example_one():
    
    return len(nltk.word_tokenize(moby_raw)) # or alternatively len(text1)

example_one()


# ### Example 2
# 
# How many unique tokens (unique words and punctuation) does text1 have?
# 
# *This function should return an integer.*

# In[3]:

def example_two():
    
    return len(set(nltk.word_tokenize(moby_raw))) # or alternatively len(set(text1))

example_two()


# ### Example 3
# 
# After lemmatizing the verbs, how many unique tokens does text1 have?
# 
# *This function should return an integer.*

# In[4]:

from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

def example_three():

    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w,'v') for w in text1]

    return len(set(lemmatized))

example_three()


# ### Question 1
# 
# What is the lexical diversity of the given text input? (i.e. ratio of unique tokens to the total number of tokens)
# 
# *This function should return a float.*

# In[5]:

def answer_one():
    
    
    return example_two()/example_one()

answer_one()


# ### Question 2
# 
# What percentage of tokens is 'whale'or 'Whale'?
# 
# *This function should return a float.*

# In[6]:

def answer_two():
    
    
    return (text1.vocab()['whale'] + text1.vocab()['Whale']) / len(nltk.word_tokenize(moby_raw)) * 100 # Your answer here

answer_two()


# ### Question 3
# 
# What are the 20 most frequently occurring (unique) tokens in the text? What is their frequency?
# 
# *This function should return a list of 20 tuples where each tuple is of the form `(token, frequency)`. The list should be sorted in descending order of frequency.*

# In[7]:

def answer_three():
    import operator

    return sorted(text1.vocab().items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)[:20] # Your answer here

answer_three()


# ### Question 4
# 
# What tokens have a length of greater than 5 and frequency of more than 150?
# 
# *This function should return a sorted list of the tokens that match the above constraints. To sort your list, use `sorted()`*

# In[8]:

def answer_four():
    
    
    return sorted([token for token, freq in text1.vocab().items() if len(token) > 5 and freq > 150]) # Your answer here

answer_four()


# ### Question 5
# 
# Find the longest word in text1 and that word's length.
# 
# *This function should return a tuple `(longest_word, length)`.*

# In[9]:

def answer_five():
    import operator
    
    return sorted([(token, len(token))for token, freq in text1.vocab().items()], key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)[0] # Your answer here

answer_five()


# ### Question 6
# 
# What unique words have a frequency of more than 2000? What is their frequency?
# 
# "Hint:  you may want to use `isalpha()` to check if the token is a word and not punctuation."
# 
# *This function should return a list of tuples of the form `(frequency, word)` sorted in descending order of frequency.*

# In[10]:

def answer_six():
    import operator
    
    return sorted([(freq, token) for token, freq in text1.vocab().items() if freq > 2000 and token.isalpha()], key=operator.itemgetter(0), reverse=True) # Your answer here

answer_six()


# ### Question 7
# 
# What is the average number of tokens per sentence?
# 
# *This function should return a float.*

# In[11]:

def answer_seven():
    
    
    return np.mean([len(nltk.word_tokenize(sent)) for sent in nltk.sent_tokenize(moby_raw)]) # Your answer here

answer_seven()


# ### Question 8
# 
# What are the 5 most frequent parts of speech in this text? What is their frequency?
# 
# *This function should return a list of tuples of the form `(part_of_speech, frequency)` sorted in descending order of frequency.*

# In[12]:

def answer_eight():
    from collections import Counter
    import operator
    
    return sorted(Counter([tag for token, tag in nltk.pos_tag(text1)]).items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)[:5] # Your answer here

answer_eight()


# ## Part 2 - Spelling Recommender
# 
# For this part of the assignment you will create three different spelling recommenders, that each take a list of misspelled words and recommends a correctly spelled word for every word in the list.
# 
# For every misspelled word, the recommender should find find the word in `correct_spellings` that has the shortest distance*, and starts with the same letter as the misspelled word, and return that word as a recommendation.
# 
# *Each of the three different recommenders will use a different distance measure (outlined below).
# 
# Each of the recommenders should provide recommendations for the three default words provided: `['cormulent', 'incendenece', 'validrate']`.

# In[13]:

from nltk.corpus import words

correct_spellings = words.words()


# ### Question 9
# 
# For this recommender, your function should provide recommendations for the three default words provided above using the following distance metric:
# 
# **[Jaccard distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) on the trigrams of the two words.**
# 
# *This function should return a list of length three:
# `['cormulent_reccomendation', 'incendenece_reccomendation', 'validrate_reccomendation']`.*

# In[14]:

def answer_nine(entries=['cormulent', 'incendenece', 'validrate']):
    result = []
    import operator
    for entry in entries:
        spell_list = [spell for spell in correct_spellings if spell.startswith(entry[0]) and len(spell) > 2]
        distance_list = [(spell, nltk.jaccard_distance(set(nltk.ngrams(entry, n=3)), set(nltk.ngrams(spell, n=3)))) for spell in spell_list]

        result.append(sorted(distance_list, key=operator.itemgetter(1))[0][0])
    
    return result # Your answer here
    
answer_nine()


# ### Question 10
# 
# For this recommender, your function should provide recommendations for the three default words provided above using the following distance metric:
# 
# **[Jaccard distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) on the 4-grams of the two words.**
# 
# *This function should return a list of length three:
# `['cormulent_reccomendation', 'incendenece_reccomendation', 'validrate_reccomendation']`.*

# In[15]:

def answer_ten(entries=['cormulent', 'incendenece', 'validrate']):
    result = []
    import operator
    for entry in entries:
        spell_list = [spell for spell in correct_spellings if spell.startswith(entry[0]) and len(spell) > 2]
        distance_list = [(spell, nltk.jaccard_distance(set(nltk.ngrams(entry, n=4)), set(nltk.ngrams(spell, n=4)))) for spell in spell_list]

        result.append(sorted(distance_list, key=operator.itemgetter(1))[0][0])
    
    return result # Your answer here
    
answer_ten()


# ### Question 11
# 
# For this recommender, your function should provide recommendations for the three default words provided above using the following distance metric:
# 
# **[Edit distance on the two words with transpositions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)**
# 
# *This function should return a list of length three:
# `['cormulent_reccomendation', 'incendenece_reccomendation', 'validrate_reccomendation']`.*

# In[16]:

def answer_eleven(entries=['cormulent', 'incendenece', 'validrate']):
    result = []
    import operator
    for entry in entries:
        spell_list = [spell for spell in correct_spellings if spell.startswith(entry[0]) and len(spell) > 2]
        distance_list = [(spell, nltk.edit_distance(entry, spell, transpositions=True)) for spell in spell_list]

        result.append(sorted(distance_list, key=operator.itemgetter(1))[0][0])
